                The first time I was introduced to programming was during my final year at school in Lebanon. During that time, I was selected from my class to represent my school (LWIS - Universal School of Lebanon) in the national Vex Robotics competetion. My role in the team was to program the robots movement which could alternate between moving autonomously or by the controllerâ€™s input.

                After graduating from school, I moved to London to study computer science at Queen Mary University of London. During my time at university, I learned a lot computing and programming theory. This degree helped enhance my knowledge on computers and provided me with an introduction into programming.
